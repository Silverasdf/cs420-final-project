# cs420-final-project

## Usage

This project is a script that takes in a MIDI file and outputs a csv file with data and a plot of the recall versus the noise. I have a script (script.py)
that you can run that automatically runs this. All you need to do is:

```bash
# Install the required packages
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib pandas numpy mido
python script.py
```

You will the csv file and the plot under the outputs directory.
